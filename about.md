Hi — I’m Horst Herb. I am the lead developer of the open source project "BMLibrarian" - an AI enhanced multiagentic biomedical literature research system. 
This site is a place to document projects and write short posts about repositories I maintain.
From time to time, there will also be tutorials for developes willing to comntribute to the project.
