Hi, I'm **Horst Herb**. Welcome to my developer blog where I share notes, tutorials, and updates about my open source projects.

I'm currently focused on [BMLibrarian](https://github.com/hherb/BMLibrarian) — an AI-enhanced multi-agent biomedical literature research system. Here you'll find developer guides, architecture deep-dives, and project updates.
